Haryo Sukmawanto is a visual artist and photographer based in Brussels, Belgium. 

In 2017 he graduated from the Ghent Royal Academy of Fine Arts. Haryo has since then shifted towards a multimedial technological approach to photography. His work examines the digital image, down to its core as an array of ones and zeros, and its impact on perception, experience and memory.

He was a member of the production team for visual artist [David Claerbout](https://davidclaerbout.com/), assisting him in works such as _the 'confetti' piece_ and _Olympia_. In November 2021 he joined the team at the digital arts and performance company [CREW](https://crew.brussels/) as a technical collaborator creating immersive VR experiences.

Haryo is available to assist you with your 3D, photographic and other visual projects. Contact him on one of the channels listed at the bottom.
