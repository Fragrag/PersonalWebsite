Haryo Sukmawanto is a visual artist and photographer based in Ghent, Belgium. 

In 2017 he graduated from the Ghent Royal Academy of Fine Arts. Haryo has since then shifted towards a multimedial technological approach to photography. His work examines the digital image, down to its core as an array of ones and zeros, and its impact on perception, experience and memory.
