In collaboration with the artist we looked for a way to display the versatility of the torsion of strings and the impact it has on a fabric as a whole.

Using Javascript and the p5.js library I created a website that displays a variety of fabric patterns and structures. The user can dynamically change the colors of the patterns, letting them see the impact it has on it and showing the infinite possibilities
