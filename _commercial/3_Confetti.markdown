_"The motif of the work is a single moment in time taken from an event that looks like a local election celebration in the United States. Thousands of confetti are falling from the sky, as guests are starting to clap their hands.Set in a neo-classical building, the falling confetti pulls all gazes upwards. The particles , tumbling down gently like transparent flower petals seem to be an index of lightness."_
